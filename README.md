# mv-cart

Hi! This is my entry to the coding assignment thing - Jacob

## Recommended IDE Setup

[VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) + [Volar](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.volar) (and disable Vetur).

## Project Setup

```sh
npm install
```

### Compile and Hot-Reload for Development

```sh
npm run dev
```

### Run Unit Tests with [Cypress]

```sh
npx cypress open
```

This of course, has to be run with the Elixir + Phoenix Backend:
